                <h3>Field with a Barn</h3>
                <p>Star Valley was settled in the late 1870s by Mormon pioneers. Primary sources indicate Star Valley was proclaimed the "Star of All Valleys" for its natural beauty by a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The name was later shortened to Star Valley.</p>

                <p>Star Valley was inhabited mainly by Shoshone Indians in the summer and fall months until the early 19th century. The natives were drawn to the valley for its abundant game and the pure salt deposits found near the present town of Auburn and also to the south of Afton, Wyoming there are more renowned salt deposits.</p>

                <p>The tower is a sacred site for many Plains Indians as well as a popular site for rock climbing. The month of June is a particularly important time in the Plains religious calendar, when many individuals visit sacred sites to conduct religious services. June is also one of the more popular climbing months.</p>

                <h3>Elkhorn Arch</h3>
                <p>Tucked away in Star Valley there is an enormous arch made entirely of elk antlers. The arch spans all four lanes of U.S. Route 89 as the highway passes through downtown Afton. The arch is 18-feet tall and 75-feet wide. Smaller elk antler arches flank each side of the arch‚Äôs base. Although Jackson Hole‚Äôs elk antler arches are more widely known, the antler arch in Afton is believed to be the largest in the world.</p>

                <p>Star Valley Wyoming hosts quite a variety of fishing opportunities. The Salt River that flows through the valley offers great fishing for brown, rainbow and cutthroat trout, the Grey's River and little Greys River are home to many fine cutthroat trout and Alpine Canyon's Snake River provides great whitewater adventure fishing for cutthroats. Star Valley is only a 20 mile drive to the world class fly-fishery the South Fork of the Snake. If you prefer lake fishing to rivers 20 mile long Palisades Reservoir provides fishing opportunities for all of the above as well as Kokanee Salmon.</p>
